EasyHCI
=======

Source code for EasyHCI: HCI using Gesture Input.

This project provides users with a low cost Human Computer Interaction software that is able detect motion  and is able to decode that motion to detect gestures based on which Windows OS operations can be performed.

The project sees the implementation of SURF algorithm and CAMshift algorithm for object detection and tracking. 
Technologies used: C#.NET, VB.NET, OpenCV


Lead developers: Abhishek Mirge
OpenCV: Saket Joshi
VB module: Shounak Gujarathi
